        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p><strong>Problem: Reverse Alternating K-Element Sublist</strong></p>
        
        <p>Given the head of a LinkedList and a number k, reverse every alternating k sized sub-list starting from the head.</p>
        
        <p>If, in the end, you are left with a sub-list with less than k elements, reverse it too.</p>
        
        <div class="example">
            <p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Input:</strong> head = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8], k = 2</p>
            <p><strong>Output:</strong> [2,1,3,4,6,5,7,8]</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The first group of 2 elements [1,2] is reversed. The second group [3,4] remains as is (since we're reversing alternating groups). The third group [5,6] is reversed. The last group [7,8] remains as is.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="example">
            <p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Input:</strong> head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 3</p>
            <p><strong>Output:</strong> [3,2,1,4,5]</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The first group of 3 elements [1,2,3] is reversed. The remaining elements [4,5] remain as is (since we're reversing alternating groups and this would be the second group).</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="section understanding">
        <h2>Understanding</h2>
        <p>
            This problem builds upon the "Reverse every K-element sublist" problem, but with an important distinction: we only reverse alternate groups of k elements, leaving the other groups as they are.
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, if we have a linked list 1→2→3→4→5→6→7→8 and k=2:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The first group of 2 elements [1,2] will be reversed to [2,1]</li>
            <li>The second group of 2 elements [3,4] will remain as [3,4]</li>
            <li>The third group of 2 elements [5,6] will be reversed to [6,5]</li>
            <li>The fourth group of 2 elements [7,8] will remain as [7,8]</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            So the result would be 2→1→3→4→6→5→7→8.
        </p>
        <p>
            Similarly, if we have a linked list 1→2→3→4→5 and k=3:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The first group of 3 elements [1,2,3] will be reversed to [3,2,1]</li>
            <li>The second group (which has only 2 elements) [4,5] will remain as [4,5]</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            So the result would be 3→2→1→4→5.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section approach">
        <h2>Approach</h2>
        <div class="key-insight">
            <p><strong>Key Insight:</strong> We'll use the same in-place reversal technique as in the "Reverse every K-element sublist" problem, but we'll add a counter to track which groups to reverse.</p>
        </div>
        <p>
            The approach to solve this problem is similar to reversing every k-element sublist, but with an additional flag or counter to decide whether to reverse a group or skip it:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>We'll traverse the linked list one node at a time.</li>
            <li>For each group of k nodes, we'll check if it's an odd-numbered group (1st, 3rd, 5th, etc.) or an even-numbered group (2nd, 4th, 6th, etc.).</li>
            <li>If it's an odd-numbered group, we'll reverse it using the standard in-place reversal technique.</li>
            <li>If it's an even-numbered group, we'll skip the reversal and simply move the pointers forward to the next group.</li>
            <li>If there are fewer than k elements at the end, we'll check if it's an odd-numbered group. If yes, we'll reverse it; otherwise, we'll leave it as is.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <div class="visualization">
            <p><strong>Visualization for Example 1 (head = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8], k = 2):</strong></p>
            <pre>
Original List: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8 -> NULL

Group 1 (odd - reverse): [1,2]
After Reversal: 2 -> 1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8 -> NULL

Group 2 (even - skip): [3,4]
After Skip: 2 -> 1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8 -> NULL

Group 3 (odd - reverse): [5,6]
After Reversal: 2 -> 1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 6 -> 5 -> 7 -> 8 -> NULL

Group 4 (even - skip): [7,8]

        <p>
            <strong>Time Complexity:</strong> O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the linked list. We process each node at most twice (once to count the elements in a group and once to reverse or skip it).
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Space Complexity:</strong> O(1), as we are doing the reversal in-place and only using a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size.

        <h2>Implementation Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Initialize a variable to keep track of whether we're on an odd or even group (let's call it <code>groupCount</code> and start with 1).</li>
            <li>Use a pointer <code>current</code> to iterate through the linked list.</li>
            <li>For each group of k nodes:
                <ul>
                    <li>If <code>groupCount</code> is odd, reverse the group.</li>
                    <li>If <code>groupCount</code> is even, skip the group (just move the pointers forward).</li>
                    <li>Increment <code>groupCount</code>.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>If there are fewer than k elements at the end and <code>groupCount</code> is odd, reverse those elements.</li>
            <li>Return the new head of the linked list.</li>

        <h2>Differences from Reverse Every K-Element Sublist</h2>
        <p>The key differences between this problem (Reverse Alternating K-Element Sublist) and the Reverse Every K-Element Sublist problem are:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Selective Reversal:</strong> In this problem, we only reverse odd-numbered groups (1st, 3rd, 5th, etc.) while leaving even-numbered groups (2nd, 4th, 6th, etc.) as they are. In contrast, the original problem reverses every group of k elements.</li>
            <li><strong>Group Tracking:</strong> This problem requires us to keep track of which group we're currently processing (odd or even), which adds an extra layer of complexity.</li>
            <li><strong>Edge Cases:</strong> We need to handle edge cases differently. For example, if there are fewer than k elements at the end of the list, we only reverse them if they form an odd-numbered group.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The core technique of in-place reversal remains the same in both problems, but this problem requires additional logic to determine which groups to reverse.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section approach">
        <h2>Common Pitfalls</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Incorrect Indexing:</strong> Be careful about indexing the groups correctly. Remember that the first group is group 1 (odd), the second group is group 2 (even), and so on.</li>
            <li><strong>Not Handling Incomplete Groups:</strong> Don't forget to check if the last group has fewer than k elements and handle it appropriately based on whether it's an odd or even group.</li>
            <li><strong>Breaking Links:</strong> Be careful when manipulating pointers to avoid creating loops or disconnecting parts of the list.</li>
            <li><strong>Off-by-One Errors:</strong> When counting elements in a group, make sure you count exactly k elements, not k-1 or k+1.</li>
