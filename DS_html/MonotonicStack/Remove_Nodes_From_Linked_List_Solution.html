    <h1>Remove Nodes From Linked List</h1>

    <div class="section problem">
        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p>Given the head node of a singly linked list, modify the list such that any node that has a node with a greater value to its right gets removed. The function should return the head of the modified list.</p>
        
        <div class="example">
            <p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Input:</strong> 5 -> 3 -> 7 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1</p>
            <p><strong>Output:</strong> 7 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> 5 and 3 are removed as they have nodes with larger values to their right.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="example">
            <p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Input:</strong> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5</p>
            <p><strong>Output:</strong> 5</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> 1, 2, 3, and 4 are removed as they have nodes with larger values to their right.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="example">
            <p><strong>Example 3:</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Input:</strong> 5 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1</p>
            <p><strong>Output:</strong> 5 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> No nodes are removed as none have nodes with greater values to their right.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="section understanding">
        <h2>Understanding</h2>
        <p>The problem asks us to remove any node that has a node with a greater value somewhere to its right in the linked list.</p>
        <p>For example:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>In the list 5 -> 3 -> 7 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>5 is removed because 7 is to its right and is greater</li>
                <li>3 is removed because 7 is to its right and is greater</li>
                <li>7 remains because no node to its right has a greater value</li>
                <li>4 remains because no node to its right has a greater value</li>
                <li>2 remains because no node to its right has a greater value</li>
                <li>1 remains because no node to its right has a greater value</li>
            </ul>
            <li>The resulting list is 7 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This is a perfect use case for the monotonic stack pattern, as we need to find the next greater node for each node in the list.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section approach">
        <h2>Approach</h2>
        <p>We can solve this problem using a monotonic stack approach. The idea is to:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Traverse the list and use a decreasing monotonic stack to keep track of nodes</li>
            <li>When we find a node with a value greater than nodes in our stack, we pop those nodes (effectively removing them from the final list)</li>
            <li>Connect the remaining nodes to form our result list</li>
        </ol>
        <p>However, there's a challenge with linked lists: when we want to remove a node, we need access to its previous node to update the pointers. We have two main approaches to solve this:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Approach 1:</strong> Keep track of both the node and its previous node in the stack</li>
            <li><strong>Approach 2:</strong> Reverse the linked list, apply the algorithm, then reverse it back</li>
            <li><strong>Approach 3:</strong> Build a new list by traversing the original list from right to left (requires reversing or using recursion)</li>
        </ol>
        <p>We'll implement Approach 1 as it's more straightforward and doesn't require multiple passes.</p>

        <h3>Example Walkthrough</h3>
        <p>Let's trace through the algorithm for the list 5 -> 3 -> 7 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1:</p>
        <pre>
# Initialize empty stack, temp = head (5), prev = None

# Process node 5:
# - Stack is empty, add (5, None) to stack
# - stack = [(5, None)], prev = 5, temp = 3

# Process node 3:
# - Stack is not empty, but 3 < 5, so we don't pop anything
# - Add (3, 5) to stack
# - stack = [(5, None), (3, 5)], prev = 3, temp = 7

# Process node 7:
# - 7 > 3, so pop (3, 5) from stack
#   - Update 5.next = 7 (removing 3)
#   - prev = 5
# - 7 > 5, so pop (5, None) from stack
#   - Update head = 7 (removing 5)
#   - prev = None
# - Add (7, None) to stack
# - stack = [(7, None)], prev = 7, temp = 4

# Process node 4:
# - 4 < 7, so we don't pop anything
# - Add (4, 7) to stack
# - stack = [(7, None), (4, 7)], prev = 4, temp = 2

# Process node 2:
# - 2 < 4, so we don't pop anything
# - Add (2, 4) to stack
# - stack = [(7, None), (4, 7), (2, 4)], prev = 2, temp = 1

# Process node 1:
# - 1 < 2, so we don't pop anything
# - Add (1, 2) to stack
# - stack = [(7, None), (4, 7), (2, 4), (1, 2)], prev = 1, temp = None

# End of list, return head = 7
# Final list: 7 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1</pre>

        <h2>Time and Space Complexity</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Time Complexity:</strong> O(n) where n is the number of nodes in the linked list. Each node is processed once and can be pushed/popped from the stack at most once.</li>
            <li><strong>Space Complexity:</strong> O(n) for the stack in the worst case, which could store all nodes if the list is already in decreasing order.</li>

        <h2>Connection to Monotonic Stack Pattern</h2>
        <p>This problem illustrates the monotonic stack pattern in the context of linked lists:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>We're essentially looking for the next greater element (value) for each node</li>
            <li>We maintain a monotonic decreasing stack to efficiently identify nodes that should be removed</li>
            <li>The main adaptation is handling the linked list pointers correctly while removing nodes</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The core principle of the monotonic stack remains the same: we pop elements from our stack when we find a larger element, but we've adapted it to maintain the linked list structure.</p>
