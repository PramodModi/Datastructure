    <h1>Insert Interval Problem</h1>

    <div class="section problem">
        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p><strong>Problem Description: Insert Interval (LeetCode #57)</strong></p>
        <p><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/insert-interval/" target="_blank">https://leetcode.com/problems/insert-interval/</a></p>
        <p>
            You are given an array of non-overlapping intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi] represent the start and the end of the ith interval and intervals is sorted in ascending order by starti. You are also given an interval newInterval = [start, end] that represents the start and end of another interval.
        </p>
        <p>
            Insert newInterval into intervals such that intervals is still sorted in ascending order by starti and intervals still does not have any overlapping intervals (merge overlapping intervals if necessary).
        </p>
        <p>
            Return intervals after the insertion.
        </p>
        
        <div class="example">
            <p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Input:</strong> intervals = [[1,3],[6,9]], newInterval = [2,5]</p>
            <p><strong>Output:</strong> [[1,5],[6,9]]</p>

            <p><strong>Output:</strong> [[1,2],[3,10],[12,16]]</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Because the new interval [4,8] overlaps with [3,5],[6,7],[8,10].</p>

        <p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>0 <= intervals.length <= 10<sup>4</sup></li>
            <li>intervals[i].length == 2</li>

    <div class="section understanding">
        <h2>Understanding</h2>
        <p>
            This problem is about handling intervals in a sorted collection. We need to perform two main operations:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Insert a new interval</strong> while maintaining the sorted order based on start times.</li>
            <li><strong>Merge any overlapping intervals</strong> to ensure the final collection doesn't have any overlaps.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            The challenge lies in correctly identifying where to place the new interval and how to efficiently merge overlaps. The input intervals are already sorted and non-overlapping, which provides a helpful starting point.
        </p>
        <p>
            An interval [a, b] overlaps with another interval [c, d] if and only if b >= c and d >= a. When intervals overlap, they should be merged into a single interval with the start being the minimum of both starts and the end being the maximum of both ends.
        </p>
        <p>
            We need to handle various scenarios like inserting at the beginning, middle, or end of the array, as well as potential multiple overlaps with the new interval.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section approach">
        <h2>Approach</h2>
        <p>
            The solution uses a straightforward approach consisting of two main steps:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Insert the new interval</strong> into the correct position based on its start value.</li>
            <li><strong>Merge overlapping intervals</strong> to maintain the non-overlapping property.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            <strong>Data Structure Choice:</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            We use lists to represent the intervals since they allow for easy insertion operations and provide constant-time access to elements by index. The intervals themselves are represented as pairs [start, end], which is a natural representation for intervals.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Time and Space Complexity:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Time Complexity:</strong> O(n) where n is the number of intervals. We need to iterate through the array at most twice - once to insert the new interval and once to merge overlapping intervals.</li>
            <li><strong>Space Complexity:</strong> O(n) for storing the result array.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <strong>Why This Approach Works Well:</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            This approach leverages the given property that the intervals are already sorted by start times. By inserting the new interval in the correct position first, we maintain this sorted property, which makes the subsequent merging step simpler. The merging step then only needs to compare adjacent intervals to identify overlaps.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is more efficient than alternatives like inserting the new interval and then resorting the entire array, which would have a time complexity of O(n log n).
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section steps">
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Insert the new interval in the correct position:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Handle the edge case where the array is empty or the first interval's start is greater than or equal to the new interval's start. In this case, insert at the beginning.</li>
                    <li>Otherwise, iterate through the array to find the correct position where the new interval's start is less than the next interval's start.</li>
                    <li>If we reach the end without inserting, append the new interval at the end.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Merge overlapping intervals:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Start with the first interval as our current interval.</li>
                    <li>For each subsequent interval, check if it overlaps with the current interval (current.end >= next.start).</li>
                    <li>If there's an overlap, merge them by taking the minimum of starts and maximum of ends.</li>
                    <li>If there's no overlap, add the current interval to the result and update the current interval.</li>
                    <li>After processing all intervals, add the last current interval to the result.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            This approach handles all edge cases efficiently including empty arrays, inserting at the beginning/end, and multiple overlapping intervals.

        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>The new interval [4,8] is inserted between [3,5] and [6,7] because 4 > 3 and 4 < 6.</li>
            <li>After insertion, the intervals array becomes: [[1,2], [3,5], [4,8], [6,7], [8,10], [12,16]].</li>
            <li>We start merging with temp = [1,2].</li>
            <li>Since 2 < 3, there's no overlap, so we add [1,2] to result and set temp = [3,5].</li>
            <li>Since 5 >= 4, [3,5] and [4,8] overlap, so temp becomes [3,8].</li>
            <li>Since 8 >= 6, [3,8] and [6,7] overlap, so temp remains [3,8] (max end is still 8).</li>
            <li>Since 8 >= 8, [3,8] and [8,10] overlap, so temp becomes [3,10].</li>
            <li>Since 10 < 12, there's no overlap, so we add [3,10] to result and set temp = [12,16].</li>
            <li>Finally, we add [12,16] to result, giving the final answer: [[1,2], [3,10], [12,16]].</li>
