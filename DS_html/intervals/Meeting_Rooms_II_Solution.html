        <p><strong>Problem Description: Meeting Rooms II</strong></p>
        <p><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/meeting-rooms-ii/" target="_blank">https://leetcode.com/problems/meeting-rooms-ii/</a></p>
        <p>
            Given an array of meeting time intervals consisting of start and end times [[s1,e1],[s2,e2],…] (si < ei), find the minimum number of conference rooms required.
        </p>
        
        <div class="example">
            <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Input:</strong> [[0, 30],[5, 10],[15, 20]]</p>
            <p><strong>Output:</strong> 2</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> We need one room for the meeting from [0,30], and another room for the meetings [5,10] and [15,20] (which can use the same room since they don't overlap).</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="example">
            <p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Input:</strong> [[7,10],[2,4]]</p>
            <p><strong>Output:</strong> 1</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The meetings don't overlap, so only one room is needed.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>0 <= intervals.length</li>
            <li>intervals[i].length == 2</li>
            <li>0 <= start_i < end_i</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section understanding">
        <h2>Understanding</h2>
        <p>
            This problem asks us to find the minimum number of conference rooms required to accommodate all the meetings. Unlike the Meeting Rooms I problem where we simply needed to determine if a person could attend all meetings, here we need to count how many parallel meetings can occur at the same time.
        </p>
        <p>
            Key insights to understand this problem:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>If meetings overlap, they must be scheduled in different rooms.</li>
            <li>If a meeting ends before another one starts, the same room can be reused.</li>
            <li>The minimum number of rooms required is equal to the maximum number of concurrent meetings at any point in time.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            For example, with intervals [[0, 30],[5, 10],[15, 20]]:
            <ul>
                <li>At time 0, meeting [0,30] starts, requiring 1 room.</li>
                <li>At time 5, meeting [5,10] starts, requiring a second room because [0,30] is still ongoing.</li>
                <li>At time 10, meeting [5,10] ends, freeing up one room.</li>
                <li>At time 15, meeting [15,20] starts and can use the freed-up room.</li>
                <li>At no point do we need more than 2 rooms, so the answer is 2.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section approach">
        <h2>Approach</h2>
        <p>
            There are two main approaches to solve this problem:
        </p>
        
        <h3>Approach 1: Min Heap (Priority Queue)</h3>
        <p>
            This approach simulates the allocation and freeing of rooms:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Sort all meetings by their start time.</li>
            <li>Use a min heap (priority queue) to track the end times of meetings in progress.</li>
            <li>Iterate through each meeting. For each meeting:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Check if any previous meeting has ended (top of heap ≤ current meeting start).</li>
                <li>If yes, remove it from the heap (room is freed).</li>
                <li>Add the current meeting's end time to the heap (allocate a room).</li>
            </ul>
            <li>The size of the heap at the end represents the minimum number of rooms required.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3>Approach 2: End Time Sorting</h3>
        <p>
            An alternative approach is to track rooms using end time sorting:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Sort meetings by their end times.</li>
            <li>Process each meeting in end time order.</li>
            <li>If a meeting overlaps with the tracked meeting, we need another room.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, we can reuse the same room.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>
            <strong>Data Structure Choice:</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            For Approach 1, we use a min heap (priority queue) because:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>It efficiently keeps track of the earliest ending meeting (which is the first one we want to check for reuse).</li>
            <li>Operations like extracting the minimum and inserting new elements are O(log n).</li>
            <li>This is more efficient than repeatedly sorting or searching through a list.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
            <strong>Time and Space Complexity:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Time Complexity:</strong> O(n log n) where n is the number of meetings. The sorting step takes O(n log n) time, and each heap operation takes O(log n) time, which we do n times.</li>
            <li><strong>Space Complexity:</strong> O(n) for storing the heap, which in the worst case might contain all meetings simultaneously.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section steps">
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <h3>Priority Queue (Min Heap) Approach:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Handle edge cases:</strong> If there are no meetings, return 0.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Sort meetings</strong> by their start times to process them in chronological order.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Initialize a min heap</strong> with the end time of the first meeting.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Iterate through remaining meetings:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Check if the earliest ending meeting (top of heap) has ended by the time the current meeting starts.</li>
                    <li>If yes, remove that meeting's end time from the heap (freeing up a room).</li>
                    <li>Add the current meeting's end time to the heap (allocating a room).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Return the size of the heap</strong> as the minimum number of rooms required.
            </li>
        </ol>

            <h3>Alternative Implementation (End Time Sorting):</h3>
            <p>This approach sorts meetings by their end times and keeps track of which room is currently occupied:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Sort meetings by their end times.</li>
                <li>Initialize with the first meeting and one room.</li>
                <li>For each subsequent meeting, check if it overlaps with the current tracked meeting.</li>
                <li>If it overlaps, increment the room count.</li>
                <li>Otherwise, update the current tracked meeting.</li>
            </ol>
