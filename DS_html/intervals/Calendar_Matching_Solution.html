    <h1>Calendar Matching Problem</h1>

    <div class="section problem">
        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p><strong>Problem Description: Calendar Matching</strong></p>
        <p>
            Imagine that you want to schedule a meeting of a certain duration with a co-worker. You have access to
            your calendar and your co-worker's calendar (both of which contain your respective meetings for the
            day, in the form of [startTime, endTime]), as well as both of your daily bounds (i.e., the earliest
            and latest times at which you're available for meetings every day, in the form of
            [earliestTime, latestTime]).
        </p>
        <p>
            Write a function that takes in your calendar, your daily bounds, your co-worker's calendar, your co-worker's daily bounds, and the duration of the meeting that you want to schedule, and that returns a
            list of all the time blocks (in the form of [startTime, endTime]) during which you could schedule
            the meeting, ordered from earliest time block to latest.
        </p>
        <p>
            Note that times will be given and should be returned in military time. For example: 8:30, 9:01, and
            23:56.
        </p>
        <p>
            Also note that the given calendar times will be sorted by start time in ascending order, as you would
            expect them to appear in a calendar application like Google Calendar.
        </p>
        
        <div class="example">
            <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
            <p><strong>calendar1</strong> = [['9:00', '10:30'], ['12:00', '13:00'], ['16:00', '18:00']]</p>
            <p><strong>dailyBounds1</strong> = ['9:00', '20:00']</p>
            <p><strong>calendar2</strong> = [['10:00', '11:30'], ['12:30', '14:30'], ['14:30', '15:00'], ['16:00', '17:00']]</p>
            <p><strong>dailyBounds2</strong> = ['10:00', '18:30']</p>
            <p><strong>meetingDuration</strong> = 30</p>
            <p><strong>Output:</strong> [['11:30', '12:00'], ['15:00', '16:00'], ['18:00', '18:30']]</p>

        <h2>Understanding</h2>
        <p>
            This problem asks us to find all possible time slots for scheduling a meeting between two people, given their existing calendars and availability bounds. To solve this, we need to understand several key concepts:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Calendars</strong>: Each person has a list of existing meetings in their calendar for the day.</li>
            <li><strong>Daily Bounds</strong>: Each person has a time range within which they are available for meetings.</li>
            <li><strong>Meeting Duration</strong>: The new meeting requires a specific amount of time.</li>
            <li><strong>Available Time Slots</strong>: We need to find all time periods where both people are free and the slot is at least as long as the required meeting duration.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            To find these available slots, we need to:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Consider both calendars and both people's daily bounds.</li>
            <li>Find all times where both people are free.</li>
            <li>Filter for slots that are long enough for the meeting.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            This is essentially an interval merging and gap finding problem. We need to merge all the busy times (meetings) from both calendars, then find the gaps between these busy times that are within both people's availability bounds and long enough for our meeting.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section approach">
        <h2>Approach</h2>
        <p>
            We'll use a systematic approach to solve this problem:
        </p>
        
        <div class="key-insight">
            <p><strong>Key Insight:</strong> By combining and flattening both calendars, we can identify all time periods where at least one person is busy, and then find the gaps between these periods to determine when both people are free.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>The algorithm works in these major steps:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Update Calendars with Daily Bounds</strong>: Add the unavailable periods before and after daily bounds to each calendar.</li>
            <li><strong>Convert Times to Minutes</strong>: For easier comparison and calculation.</li>
            <li><strong>Merge Both Calendars</strong>: Combine meetings from both calendars while maintaining order.</li>
            <li><strong>Flatten the Merged Calendar</strong>: Merge overlapping meetings into single blocks.</li>
            <li><strong>Find Available Time Slots</strong>: Identify gaps between meetings that are long enough.</li>
            <li><strong>Convert Back to Time Format</strong>: Convert the results from minutes back to time format.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>
            <strong>Data Structure Choice:</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            We use lists to represent time intervals and work with them directly. This is appropriate because:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The problem naturally represents time as intervals [start, end].</li>
            <li>The operations we need (merging, checking overlaps) are straightforward with this representation.</li>
            <li>Converting between time strings and minutes (our internal representation) is clean and efficient.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
            <strong>Time and Space Complexity:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Time Complexity:</strong> O(c1 + c2) where c1 and c2 are the lengths of the two calendars. Merging and flattening the calendars takes linear time.</li>
            <li><strong>Space Complexity:</strong> O(c1 + c2) for storing the merged and flattened calendars.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
