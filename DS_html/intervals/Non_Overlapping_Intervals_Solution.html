    <div class="section understanding">
        <h2>Understanding</h2>
        <p>
            This problem asks us to find the minimum number of intervals that need to be removed so that the remaining intervals don't overlap with each other.
        </p>
        <p>
            Two intervals [a,b] and [c,d] are considered to be overlapping if they share any common point, which means:
            <ul>
                <li>a <= c < b, or</li>
                <li>c <= a < d</li>
            </ul>
            In other words, they overlap if one interval starts before the other ends.
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, in [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,3]]:
            <ul>
                <li>[1,2] and [2,3] are not overlapping (they just touch at point 2).</li>
                <li>[2,3] and [3,4] are not overlapping (they just touch at point 3).</li>
                <li>[1,2] and [1,3] overlap because they share points 1 and 2.</li>
                <li>[1,3] and [2,3] overlap because they share point 2 and 3.</li>
                <li>[1,3] and [3,4] overlap at point 3.</li>
            </ul>
            If we remove [1,3], the remaining intervals are all non-overlapping.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section approach">
        <h2>Approach</h2>
        <p>
            The approach to this problem is based on a greedy algorithm:
        </p>
        
        <div class="key-insight">
            <p><strong>Key Insight:</strong> To minimize the number of intervals to remove, we want to keep as many intervals as possible. The optimal strategy is to always keep the interval that ends earliest among overlapping intervals.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>The algorithm works as follows:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Sort the intervals by their end time.</li>
            <li>Keep the interval with the earliest end time.</li>
            <li>Discard any interval that overlaps with the kept interval.</li>
            <li>Repeat the process with the next non-overlapping interval.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>
            <strong>Data Structure Choice:</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            We use a simple array to represent the intervals and track our current interval. We sort the intervals by end time because this allows us to apply the greedy algorithm effectively. By considering intervals in order of their end times, we can maximize the number of non-overlapping intervals we can include.
        </p>
        
        <p>This approach is different from sorting by start time (which is commonly used in other interval problems) because:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>When sorted by end time, we can make a greedy choice to always select the interval that ends earliest.</li>
            <li>This leaves as much space as possible for future intervals.</li>
            <li>It ensures we can fit the maximum number of intervals without overlap.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
            <strong>Time and Space Complexity:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Time Complexity:</strong> O(n log n) where n is the number of intervals. The sorting step takes O(n log n) time, and the subsequent traversal takes O(n) time.</li>
            <li><strong>Space Complexity:</strong> O(1) or O(n) depending on the sorting implementation. We only need constant extra space for our algorithm besides the input array.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section steps">
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Sort the intervals</strong> by their end times in ascending order.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Initialize variables:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Set <code>temp</code> to the first interval (the one that ends earliest).</li>
                    <li>Initialize <code>count</code> to 0 (to track intervals that need to be removed).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Iterate through the remaining sorted intervals:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>For each interval, check if it overlaps with <code>temp</code> by comparing <code>temp</code>'s end time with the current interval's start time.</li>
                    <li>If they don't overlap (<code>temp[1] <= interval[0]</code>), update <code>temp</code> to the current interval.</li>
                    <li>If they do overlap, increment <code>count</code> (this interval needs to be removed).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Return <code>count</code></strong> as the minimum number of intervals to be removed.
