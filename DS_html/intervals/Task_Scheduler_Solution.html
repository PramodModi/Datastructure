    <h1>Task Scheduler Problem</h1>

        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p><strong>Problem Description: Task Scheduler (LeetCode #621)</strong></p>
        <p><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/task-scheduler/" target="_blank">https://leetcode.com/problems/task-scheduler/</a></p>
        <p>
            Given a characters array tasks, representing the tasks a CPU needs to do, where each letter represents a different task. Tasks could be done in any order. Each task is done in one unit of time. For each unit of time, the CPU could complete either one task or just be idle.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, there is a non-negative integer n that represents the cooldown period between two same tasks (the same letter in the array), that is that there must be at least n units of time between any two same tasks.
        </p>
        <p>
            Return the least number of units of times that the CPU will take to finish all the given tasks.
        </p>
        
        <div class="example">
            <p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Input:</strong> tasks = ["A","A","A","B","B","B"], n = 2</p>
            <p><strong>Output:</strong> 8</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong><br>
               A -> B -> idle -> A -> B -> idle -> A -> B<br>
               There is at least 2 units of time between any two same tasks.

            <p><strong>Output:</strong> 6</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong><br>
               On this case any permutation of size 6 would work since n = 0.<br>
               ["A","A","A","B","B","B"]<br>
               ["A","B","A","B","A","B"]<br>
               ["B","B","B","A","A","A"]<br>
               And so on.

               One possible solution is:<br>

        <h2>Understanding</h2>
        <p>
            This problem is about scheduling tasks with a cooling period between identical tasks. The key points to understand are:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Each task takes exactly one unit of time to complete.</li>
            <li>After completing a task of type X, we must wait at least n units of time before executing another task of type X.</li>
            <li>During the cooling period, we can either execute other tasks or remain idle.</li>
            <li>The goal is to find the minimum time needed to complete all tasks.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Let's analyze the examples to better understand:</p>
        
        <div class="visualization">
            <p><strong>Example 1:</strong> tasks = ["A","A","A","B","B","B"], n = 2</p>
            <p>We need to execute 3 A's and 3 B's with a cooldown of 2 between same tasks.</p>
            <pre>A → B → _ → A → B → _ → A → B</pre>
            <p>Where _ represents idle time. Total time: 8 units.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Example 2:</strong> tasks = ["A","A","A","B","B","B"], n = 0</p>
            <p>With n = 0, there's no cooling period, so we can execute tasks consecutively.</p>
            <pre>A → A → A → B → B → B</pre>
            <p>Or any other permutation. Total time: 6 units.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>The key insight is that we should prioritize the most frequent tasks to minimize idle time. By scheduling the most frequent tasks first and as early as possible after their cooling periods, we can optimize the schedule.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section approach">
        <h2>Approach</h2>
        <p>
            There are two main approaches to solve this problem:
        </p>
        
        <div class="compare">
            <div class="compare-item">
                <h3>Approach 1: Simulation with Priority Queue</h3>
                <p>This approach simulates the task scheduling process:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Count the frequency of each task.</li>
                    <li>Use a max heap to prioritize tasks with higher frequencies.</li>
                    <li>Use a queue to track tasks in their cooling periods.</li>
                    <li>Simulate the CPU execution one unit of time at a time.</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
            
            <div class="compare-item">
                <h3>Approach 2: Mathematical Formula</h3>
                <p>This approach uses a mathematical formula to directly calculate the result:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Find the maximum frequency among all tasks.</li>
                    <li>Count how many tasks have this maximum frequency.</li>
                    <li>Apply a formula to calculate the minimum time required.</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="key-insight">
            <p><strong>Key Insight:</strong> The mathematical formula works because the optimal scheduling always involves placing the most frequent tasks as far apart as possible, with other tasks filling the gaps.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>
            <strong>Data Structure Choice:</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            For Approach 1 (Simulation), we use:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Counter/Dictionary</strong>: To count the frequency of each task.</li>
            <li><strong>Max Heap</strong>: To always process the task with the highest remaining frequency first.</li>
            <li><strong>Queue</strong>: To track tasks in their cooling periods and when they become available again.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            For Approach 2 (Mathematical), we only need a Counter to find the maximum frequency and count tasks with that frequency.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            <strong>Time and Space Complexity:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Approach 1 (Simulation):</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Time Complexity:</strong> O(T), where T is the total number of tasks. Each task is processed once.</li>
                    <li><strong>Space Complexity:</strong> O(1) since the number of unique tasks is limited to 26 (uppercase English letters).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Approach 2 (Mathematical):</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Time Complexity:</strong> O(T) to count the frequencies.</li>
                    <li><strong>Space Complexity:</strong> O(1) for the same reason as above.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <h3>Approach 1: Simulation with Priority Queue</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Count task frequencies:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Create a Counter object to count the frequency of each task.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Initialize data structures:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Create a max heap with the negative of each frequency (since Python has a min heap by default).</li>
                    <li>Create a queue to track tasks in cooling periods.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Simulate task execution:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Increment a time counter for each unit of time.</li>
                    <li>If the max heap is not empty, process the task with the highest frequency.</li>
                    <li>If the task still has remaining instances, add it to the cooling queue with its next available time.</li>
                    <li>Check if any task in the cooling queue is now available, and if so, add it back to the max heap.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Continue until all tasks are processed:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>The simulation ends when both the max heap and cooling queue are empty.</li>
                </ul>

        <p><strong>Explanation of the formula:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>(f_max - 1) represents the number of cooling intervals needed between occurrences of the most frequent task.</li>
            <li>(n + 1) is the length of each cooling interval plus the task itself.</li>
            <li>count_max accounts for the final execution of all tasks with maximum frequency.</li>
            <li>We take the maximum of this value and the total number of tasks, because we can't have less time than the total number of tasks.</li>
