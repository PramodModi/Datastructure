    <h1>My Calendar I Problem</h1>

    <div class="section problem">
        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p><strong>Problem Description: My Calendar I (LeetCode #729)</strong></p>
        <p><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/my-calendar-i/" target="_blank">https://leetcode.com/problems/my-calendar-i/</a></p>
        <p>
            You are implementing a program to use as your calendar. We can add a new event if adding the event will not cause a double booking.
        </p>
        <p>
            A double booking happens when two events have some non-empty intersection (i.e., some moment is common to both events.).
        </p>
        <p>
            The event can be represented as a pair of integers start and end that represents a booking on the half-open interval [start, end), the range of real numbers x such that start <= x < end.
        </p>
        <p>
            Implement the MyCalendar class:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>MyCalendar()</code> Initializes the calendar object.</li>
            <li><code>boolean book(int start, int end)</code> Returns true if the event can be added to the calendar successfully without causing a double booking. Otherwise, return false and do not add the event to the calendar.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="example">
            <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Input:</strong> ["MyCalendar", "book", "book", "book"], [[], [10, 20], [15, 25], [20, 30]]</p>
            <p><strong>Output:</strong> [null, true, false, true]</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
            <pre>
MyCalendar myCalendar = new MyCalendar();
myCalendar.book(10, 20); // return True
myCalendar.book(15, 25); // return False, It can not be booked because time 15 is already booked by another event.
myCalendar.book(20, 30); // return True, The event can be booked, as the first event takes every time less than 20, but not including 20.</pre>
        </div>
        
        <p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>0 <= start < end <= 10<sup>9</sup></li>
            <li>At most 1000 calls will be made to book.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section understanding">
        <h2>Understanding</h2>
        <p>
            This problem asks us to implement a calendar system where we can book new events only if they don't overlap with existing events. The key concepts to understand are:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Half-Open Intervals</strong>: Events are represented as intervals [start, end) where the end time is exclusive. This means an event from 10 to 20 includes all times t where 10 â‰¤ t < 20.</li>
            <li><strong>Double Booking</strong>: Two events overlap if they share any moment in time. For half-open intervals [a,b) and [c,d), they overlap if and only if a < d AND c < b.</li>
            <li><strong>Calendar Management</strong>: We need to track all booked events and efficiently check for overlaps when booking a new event.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            For example, if we have an event booked from 10 to 20:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>An event from 5 to 10 does not overlap (since 10 is included in the new event but excluded from the existing one).</li>
            <li>An event from 20 to 30 does not overlap (since 20 is excluded from the existing event).</li>
            <li>An event from 15 to 25 overlaps (since the time range 15-20 is common to both events).</li>
            <li>An event from 5 to 15 overlaps (since the time range 10-15 is common to both events).</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section approach">
        <h2>Approach</h2>
        <p>
            There are several ways to approach this problem. The implementation shown uses a binary search approach to efficiently find the correct position for a new event and check for overlaps:
        </p>
        
        <div class="key-insight">
            <p><strong>Key Insight:</strong> We maintain a sorted list of events. For each new event, we use binary search to efficiently find where it would be inserted and check if it would overlap with adjacent events.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>
            The binary search approach works as follows:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>We maintain a sorted list of events (sorted by start time).</li>
            <li>When booking a new event, we use binary search to find its position in the sorted list.</li>
            <li>During the binary search, we check if the new event overlaps with the event at the middle position.</li>
            <li>If there's an overlap, we return false; otherwise, we continue the search.</li>
            <li>After the search concludes, we insert the new event at the correct position.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>
            <strong>Data Structure Choice:</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            We use a simple list (array) to store the events. While a tree-based data structure like a balanced binary search tree would provide better theoretical time complexity for insertions, a list is sufficient for the given constraints (at most 1000 calls) and easier to implement.
        </p>
        <p>
            The events are kept sorted by start time, which allows us to use binary search to efficiently find where a new event should be inserted and to check for overlaps.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            <strong>Time and Space Complexity:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Time Complexity:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Binary search takes O(log n) time, where n is the number of events.</li>
                    <li>Insertion into an array takes O(n) time in the worst case due to shifting elements.</li>
                    <li>Overall, the book operation takes O(n) time.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Space Complexity:</strong> O(n) to store n events.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
            <strong>Alternative Approaches:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Brute Force</strong>: Check every existing event for overlap (O(n) time per booking).</li>
            <li><strong>Tree-based solution</strong>: Use a self-balancing binary search tree for O(log n) insertion and search.</li>
            <li><strong>Segment tree or interval tree</strong>: More complex data structures specifically designed for interval queries.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Initialize the calendar:</strong>
                <ul>

                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>When booking a new event [start, end):</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>If the calendar is empty, add the event and return true.</li>
                    <li>Use binary search to find where the new event should be inserted in the sorted list.</li>
                    <li>During the search, check for overlaps with existing events.</li>
                    <li>If an overlap is found, return false.</li>
                    <li>Otherwise, insert the event at the correct position and return true.</li>
