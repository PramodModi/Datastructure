    <h1>Number of Islands Problem</h1>

    <div class="section problem">
        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p><strong>Problem Description: Number of Islands (LeetCode #200)</strong></p>
        <p><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/" target="_blank">https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/</a></p>
        <p>
            Given an m x n 2D binary grid which represents a map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), return the number of islands.
        </p>
        <p>
            An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.
        </p>
        
        <div class="example">
            <p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>
            <pre>
Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]
]
Output: 1</pre>
        </div>
        
        <div class="example">
            <p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>
            <pre>
Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","1","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","1","1"]
]
Output: 3</pre>

    </div>

    <div class="section understanding">
        <h2>Understanding</h2>
        <p>
            This problem asks us to count the number of islands in a 2D grid, where:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Island:</strong> A group of connected '1's (land) that is surrounded by '0's (water).</li>
            <li><strong>Connected:</strong> Two lands are considered connected if they are adjacent horizontally or vertically (not diagonally).</li>
            <li><strong>Boundary:</strong> The edges of the grid are all considered water.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            For example, in the first example, there is only one island even though some parts are separated by water. This is because all the '1's are connected to form a single island. In the second example, there are three separate islands that aren't connected to each other.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section approach">
        <h2>Approach</h2>
        <p>
            We can solve this problem using either DFS (Depth-First Search) or BFS (Breadth-First Search) to traverse the grid and identify connected components (islands):
        </p>
        
        <div class="key-insight">
            <p><strong>Key Insight:</strong> Once we find a land cell ('1'), we can use graph traversal to mark all connected land cells as visited to ensure we count each island only once.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>The general approach is:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Iterate through each cell in the grid.</li>
            <li>When we find a land cell ('1'), we increment our island counter.</li>
            <li>We then explore all connected land cells using either DFS or BFS and mark them as visited to avoid counting them again.</li>
            <li>After traversing the entire grid, the island counter will give us the number of islands.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>
            <strong>Time and Space Complexity:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Time Complexity:</strong> O(m × n) where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns. We visit each cell at most once.</li>
            <li><strong>Space Complexity:</strong> 
                <ul>
                    <li>For DFS: O(m × n) in the worst case (if the entire grid is one island, the recursion stack could be as large as the grid).</li>
                    <li>For BFS: O(min(m, n)) for the queue.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section steps">
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <h3>DFS Approach:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Initialize island counter to 0.</li>
            <li>Iterate through each cell in the grid.</li>
            <li>If the cell is land ('1'):</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Increment island counter.</li>
                <li>Perform DFS to mark all connected land cells as visited.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Return the island counter.</li>
