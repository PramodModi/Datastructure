        <h2>Understanding</h2>
        <p>
            In this problem, we need to find the maximum number of consecutive 1's we can have in the array if we're allowed to flip at most k 0's to 1's. Let's break it down:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>We have a binary array containing only 0's and 1's.</li>
            <li>We can flip at most k 0's to 1's.</li>
            <li>We need to find the longest subarray of consecutive 1's after these flips.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            This problem is a variation of the "Longest Substring with same letters after replacement" problem, where instead of replacing any character to make all characters the same, we're specifically replacing 0's with 1's to maximize consecutive 1's.
        </p>
        <p>
            The key insight here is that for a subarray to be valid after flips, it should contain at most k 0's. This is because we can flip at most k 0's to 1's to make the entire subarray consist of consecutive 1's.
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, in [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0] with k = 2, if we consider the subarray [1,1,1,0,0], it has 2 0's, which we can flip to make it all 1's. However, if we consider the subarray [1,1,1,0,0,0], it has 3 0's, which is more than k = 2, so we can't make it all 1's after flips.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our task is to find the longest subarray that contains at most k 0's, and we'll do this using the sliding window approach.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section approach">
        <h2>Approach</h2>
        <p>
            We'll use the sliding window technique to solve this problem efficiently.
        </p>
        
        <div class="key-insight">
            <p><strong>Key Insight:</strong> For a window to be valid, it should contain at most k 0's. This means the condition (window_length - count_of_1's) <= k must be satisfied, where (window_length - count_of_1's) gives the count of 0's in the window.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>The approach is as follows:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Initialize two pointers, left and right, both starting at the beginning of the array.</li>
            <li>Keep track of the count of 1's and 0's in the current window.</li>
            <li>Expand the window by moving the right pointer and updating the counts.</li>
            <li>If the condition (window_length - count_of_1's) > k is violated (i.e., there are more than k 0's in the window), contract the window from the left until the condition is satisfied.</li>
            <li>The window length at any point gives the length of a valid subarray. Keep track of the maximum window length encountered during this process.</li>
            <li>Return the maximum window length as the answer.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <div class="visualization">
            <p><strong>Visualization of the Approach for Example 1: nums = [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0], k = 2</strong></p>
            <pre>
Initialize: left = 0, right = 0, temp = [0, 0] (count of 0's and 1's)

Iteration 1: right = 0, nums[0] = 1
  Update temp: [0, 1]
  maxFreq = 1 (count of 1's)
  window_length = 1, condition: 1 - 1 = 0 <= k, valid
  right++

Iteration 2: right = 1, nums[1] = 1
  Update temp: [0, 2]
  maxFreq = 2
  window_length = 2, condition: 2 - 2 = 0 <= k, valid
  right++

Iteration 3: right = 2, nums[2] = 1
  Update temp: [0, 3]
  maxFreq = 3
  window_length = 3, condition: 3 - 3 = 0 <= k, valid
  right++

Iteration 4: right = 3, nums[3] = 0
  Update temp: [1, 3]
  maxFreq = 3
  window_length = 4, condition: 4 - 3 = 1 <= k, valid
  right++

Iteration 5: right = 4, nums[4] = 0
  Update temp: [2, 3]
  maxFreq = 3
  window_length = 5, condition: 5 - 3 = 2 <= k, valid
  right++

Iteration 6: right = 5, nums[5] = 0
  Update temp: [3, 3]
  maxFreq = 3
  window_length = 6, condition: 6 - 3 = 3 > k, invalid
  Contract window: Remove nums[0] = 1, update temp: [3, 2]
  left++
  window_length = 5, condition: 5 - 2 = 3 > k, invalid
  Contract window: Remove nums[1] = 1, update temp: [3, 1]
  left++
  window_length = 4, condition: 4 - 1 = 3 > k, invalid
  Contract window: Remove nums[2] = 1, update temp: [3, 0]
  left++
  window_length = 3, condition: 3 - 0 = 3 > k, invalid
  Contract window: Remove nums[3] = 0, update temp: [2, 0]
  left++
  window_length = 2, condition: 2 - 0 = 2 <= k, valid
  right++

Continuing through the iterations, we find that the maximum valid window_length is 6.
This corresponds to the subarray [0,0,1,1,1,1] from indices 3 to 8, where we flip the two 0's to make all 1's.</pre>

            <p>This problem is a simpler version of the "Longest Repeating Character Replacement" problem, as we're specifically dealing with binary arrays and only replacing 0's with 1's.</p>
            <p>The core insight is that we want to find the longest subarray where the number of 0's doesn't exceed k. This is equivalent to saying (window_length - count_of_1's) <= k, which is exactly what our code checks for.</p>
            <p>The sliding window technique is particularly effective here because it allows us to efficiently track the counts of 0's and 1's as we expand and contract the window.</p>
