        <p>
            Given two strings s1 and s2, return true if s2 contains a permutation of s1, or false otherwise.
        </p>
        <p>
            In other words, return true if one of s1's permutations is the substring of s2.
        </p>
        
        <div class="example">
            <p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Input:</strong> s1 = "ab", s2 = "eidbaooo"</p>
            <p><strong>Output:</strong> true</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> s2 contains one permutation of s1 ("ba").</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="example">
            <p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Input:</strong> s1 = "ab", s2 = "eidboaoo"</p>
            <p><strong>Output:</strong> false</p>
        </div>
        
        <p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 <= s1.length, s2.length <= 10<sup>4</sup></li>
            <li>s1 and s2 consist of lowercase English letters.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section understanding">
        <h2>Understanding</h2>
        <p>
            In this problem, we need to determine if s2 contains any permutation of s1 as a substring. A permutation means any rearrangement of the characters in s1, where the frequency of each character remains the same.
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, if s1 = "ab", its permutations are "ab" and "ba". We need to check if any of these permutations appears as a substring in s2.
        </p>
        <p>
            Let's analyze the examples to understand better:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>For s1 = "ab" and s2 = "eidbaooo":</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>s1 has permutations "ab" and "ba".</li>
                    <li>Looking at s2 = "eidbaooo", we can see that the substring "ba" appears from index 2 to 3.</li>
                    <li>So, s2 does contain a permutation of s1, and the answer is true.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>For s1 = "ab" and s2 = "eidboaoo":</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Again, s1 has permutations "ab" and "ba".</li>
                    <li>Looking at s2 = "eidboaoo", neither "ab" nor "ba" appears as a contiguous substring.</li>
                    <li>So, s2 does not contain a permutation of s1, and the answer is false.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            To check if a substring of s2 is a permutation of s1, we need to ensure that the frequency of each character in the substring matches the frequency of each character in s1.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section approach">
        <h2>Approach</h2>
        <p>
            We'll use the sliding window technique combined with a character frequency counter to solve this problem efficiently.
        </p>
        
        <div class="key-insight">
            <p><strong>Key Insight:</strong> A substring of s2 is a permutation of s1 if and only if they have the same character frequencies. We can use a sliding window of size equal to the length of s1 to check all possible substrings of s2.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>The approach is as follows:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>If s1 is longer than s2, return false immediately because s2 can't contain a permutation of s1.</li>
            <li>Create a hash map to store the frequency of each character in s1.</li>
            <li>Initialize a counter for the number of unique characters in s1. This is equal to the number of keys in the hash map.</li>
            <li>Use a sliding window approach to process s2:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Expand the window by including the character at the right pointer.</li>
                <li>If the character is in our hash map, decrement its frequency. If the frequency becomes 0, decrement the unique character counter.</li>
                <li>If the window size exceeds the length of s1, contract it from the left. If the character leaving the window is in our hash map, increment its frequency. If the frequency becomes 1, increment the unique character counter.</li>
                <li>If the unique character counter becomes 0, it means we've found a substring that is a permutation of s1, so return true.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>If we've processed the entire s2 without finding a permutation, return false.</li>
        </ol>

Initialize: s1 = "ab", s2 = "eidbaooo"
Hash Map: {'a': 1, 'b': 1}
uniqueChars = 2 (number of keys in the hash map)
left = 0, right = 0

Iteration 1: right = 0, s2[0] = 'e'
  'e' is not in hash map, so do nothing
  window size = 1, which is less than s1 length, so don't contract
  uniqueChars still 2
  right++

Iteration 2: right = 1, s2[1] = 'i'
  'i' is not in hash map, so do nothing
  window size = 2, which is equal to s1 length, but uniqueChars is not 0
  Shrink window: Remove 'e', which is not in hash map
  left++
  uniqueChars still 2
  right++

Iteration 3: right = 2, s2[2] = 'd'
  'd' is not in hash map, so do nothing
  window size = 2, which is equal to s1 length, but uniqueChars is not 0
  Shrink window: Remove 'i', which is not in hash map
  left++
  uniqueChars still 2
  right++

Iteration 4: right = 3, s2[3] = 'b'
  'b' is in hash map, so temp['b'] = 0
  uniqueChars = 1
  window size = 2, which is equal to s1 length, but uniqueChars is not 0
  Shrink window: Remove 'd', which is not in hash map
  left++
  uniqueChars still 1

Iteration 5: right = 4, s2[4] = 'a'
  'a' is in hash map, so temp['a'] = 0
  uniqueChars = 0
  We found a permutation!

            <p>The uniqueChars counter is a clever optimization that helps us quickly determine if all characters in s1 have been matched correctly in the current window, without having to check the entire hash map every time.</p>
            <p>When uniqueChars becomes 0, it means all characters in s1 have been matched with their exact frequencies in the current window of s2, which indicates we've found a permutation.</p>
