            <li>Each element in nums appears once or twice</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section understanding">
        <h2>Understanding</h2>
        <p>
            In this problem, we're given an array of n integers, where each integer is in the range [1, n]. Each integer appears either once or twice in the array, and we need to find all the integers that appear twice.
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, if nums = [4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1], the array has length n = 8, and the numbers range from 1 to 8. In this array, 2 and 3 both appear twice, so our output should be [2,3].
        </p>
        <p>
            The key constraints are:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>The algorithm must run in O(n) time.</li>
            <li>The algorithm must use only constant extra space.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            This means we can't use a hash set or a frequency counter to keep track of duplicates, as that would require O(n) extra space. We need to be more clever and use the array itself to track duplicates.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section approach">
        <h2>Approach</h2>
        <p>
            The Cyclic Sort pattern is perfectly suited for this problem, as we know all numbers are in the range [1, n].
        </p>
        
        <div class="key-insight">
            <p><strong>Key Insight:</strong> After placing each number at its correct position (index = number - 1), any number that appears twice will end up at a position where it doesn't belong, because its correct position is already occupied by its first occurrence.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>The approach is as follows:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Use Cyclic Sort to sort the array so that each number is at its correct position, where the correct position for a number num is the index (num - 1).</li>
            <li>If a number is already at its correct position during sorting, it means we've already seen this number before, so it must be a duplicate.</li>
            <li>After sorting, iterate through the array again. For each position, if the number at that position doesn't match its expected value (i+1), it must be a duplicate.</li>
            <li>Collect all such numbers and return them as the result.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <div class="visualization">
            <p><strong>Visualization of the Approach for Example 1: [4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]</strong></p>
            <pre>
Initial array: [4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]

Iteration 1: i = 0, value = 4
  Correct index for 4 is 4-1 = 3
  Swap 4 with element at index 3 (which is 7)
  Array becomes: [7,3,2,4,8,2,3,1]

Iteration 1 (continued): i = 0, value = 7
  Correct index for 7 is 7-1 = 6
  Swap 7 with element at index 6 (which is 3)
  Array becomes: [3,3,2,4,8,2,7,1]

Iteration 1 (continued): i = 0, value = 3
  Correct index for 3 is 3-1 = 2
  Swap 3 with element at index 2 (which is 2)
  Array becomes: [2,3,3,4,8,2,7,1]

Iteration 1 (continued): i = 0, value = 2
  Correct index for 2 is 2-1 = 1
  Swap 2 with element at index 1 (which is 3)
  Array becomes: [3,2,3,4,8,2,7,1]

Iteration 1 (continued): i = 0, value = 3
  Correct index for 3 is 3-1 = 2
  Since element at index 2 is also 3, move to next iteration
  i = 1

... (continuing the sorting process) ...

After sorting, the array becomes: [1,2,3,4,3,2,7,8]

Now we check each position to find duplicates:
Index 0: value = 1, expected = 1, match ✓
Index 1: value = 2, expected = 2, match ✓
Index 2: value = 3, expected = 3, match ✓
Index 3: value = 4, expected = 4, match ✓
Index 4: value = 3, expected = 5, mismatch! 3 is a duplicate.
Index 5: value = 2, expected = 6, mismatch! 2 is a duplicate.
Index 6: value = 7, expected = 7, match ✓
Index 7: value = 8, expected = 8, match ✓

Result: [3, 2]</pre>

        <p>
            <strong>Time and Space Complexity:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Time Complexity:</strong> O(n), where n is the size of the array. The Cyclic Sort takes O(n) time, and the subsequent iteration to find all duplicates also takes O(n) time.</li>
            <li><strong>Space Complexity:</strong> O(1) for the algorithm itself, excluding the space required for the output array. The sorting is done in-place, and the only extra space used is for the result array, which could be up to O(n/2) in the worst case if half the elements are duplicates.</li>

            <p><strong>Understanding the Solution:</strong></p>
            <p>The key to this solution is understanding what happens during the Cyclic Sort process:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>For each number in the array, we try to place it at its correct index (number - 1).</li>
                <li>If the number is already at its correct position or if there's already a copy of this number at its correct position, we skip it and move to the next number.</li>
                <li>After the sorting process, each number should be at its correct position (index = number - 1), unless it's a duplicate.</li>
                <li>Since a number that appears twice can only be placed at its correct position once, the second occurrence will end up at a position where it doesn't belong.</li>
                <li>By checking each position after sorting, we can identify all duplicates as those numbers that are not at their correct positions.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Alternative approaches to solve this problem:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Marking with Negation:</strong> Traverse the array once and for each element nums[i], flip the sign of the element at index abs(nums[i])-1 to negative. If the element at index abs(nums[i])-1 is already negative, it means abs(nums[i]) appears twice. This approach also has O(n) time complexity and O(1) space complexity.</li>
                <li><strong>Using a Hash Set:</strong> Traverse the array once and for each element, check if it's already in the hash set. If it is, it's a duplicate. Otherwise, add it to the hash set. This approach has O(n) time complexity but O(n) space complexity, which doesn't meet the constant extra space requirement.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The Cyclic Sort approach is elegant and efficient for this problem, as it leverages the constraints of the problem (integers in the range [1, n]) to solve it with optimal time and space complexity.</p>
