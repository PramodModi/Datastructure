    <h1>Maximize Capital</h1>

    <div class="section problem">
        <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
        <p>
            Suppose LeetCode will start its IPO soon. In order to sell a good price of its shares to Venture Capital, LeetCode would like to work on some projects to increase its capital before the IPO. Since it has limited resources, it can only finish at most k distinct projects before the IPO. Help LeetCode design the best way to maximize its total capital after finishing at most k distinct projects.
        </p>
        <p>
            You are given n projects where the ith project has a pure profit <code>profits[i]</code> and a minimum capital of <code>capital[i]</code> is needed to start it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Initially, you have w capital. When you finish a project, you will obtain its pure profit and the profit will be added to your total capital.
        </p>
        <p>
            Pick a list of at most k distinct projects from given projects to maximize your final capital, and return the final maximized capital.
        </p>

        <div class="example">
            <h3>Example 1:</h3>
            <pre>
Input: k = 2, w = 0, profits = [1,2,3], capital = [0,1,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: 
- Since your initial capital is 0, you can only start the project indexed 0.
- After finishing it, you will obtain profit 1 and your capital becomes 1.
- With capital 1, you can either start project indexed 1 or 2.
- Since you can choose at most 2 projects, you need to finish the project indexed 2 to get the maximum capital.
- Therefore, output the final maximized capital, which is 0 + 1 + 3 = 4.</pre>

            <h3>Example 2:</h3>

Output: 6</pre>

        <h2>Understanding the Problem</h2>
        <p>
            In this problem, we need to select at most k projects that will maximize our final capital. The key constraints are:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Each project has a minimum capital requirement to start it</li>
            <li>We can only start a project if our current capital meets or exceeds its minimum capital requirement</li>
            <li>After completing a project, we add its profit to our capital</li>
            <li>We can complete at most k projects</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The challenge is to determine the optimal sequence of projects to undertake to maximize the final capital. This is a greedy problem where at each step we want to select the project with the highest profit among all projects that can be started with our current capital.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section approach">
        <h2>Approach: Greedy Algorithm with Two Heaps</h2>
        <p>
            We can solve this problem efficiently using a greedy approach with two heaps:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>A min heap to store projects sorted by their minimum capital requirements</li>
            <li>A max heap to store available projects' profits (projects we can start with our current capital)</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            The algorithm works as follows:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Initialize a min heap of projects sorted by capital requirements</li>
            <li>For each of the k iterations (or until no more projects can be started):
                <ul>
                    <li>Move all projects that can be started with current capital from the min heap to the max heap</li>
                    <li>If there are available projects, pick the one with the highest profit</li>
                    <li>Add the profit to the current capital</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Return the final capital</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Alternative Implementation with Sorting</h2>
        <p>
            Here's an alternative implementation that sorts the projects by capital requirement first:

        <pre>
import heapq

def findMaximizedCapital(k: int, w: int, profits: list, capital: list) -> int:
    <span class="comment">"""Alternative implementation using sorting."""

    # Max heap to store available projects by profit
    available = []
    
    # Process at most k projects
    for _ in range(k):
        # Add all projects that can be started with current capital
        while i < len(projects) and projects[i][0] <= w:
            heapq.heappush(available, -projects[i][1])  # Negate for max heap
            i += 1
        
        # If no projects are available, break
        if not available:
            break
        
        # Take the project with the highest profit
        w += -heapq.heappop(available)
    
    return w</pre>

        <p>
            This implementation has a similar time complexity of O(n log n + k log n), but might be slightly more efficient in practice as it sorts the projects once at the beginning rather than using a heap operation for each project.

    <div class="section understanding">
        <h2>Edge Cases and Considerations</h2>
        <p>
            When implementing this solution, consider these edge cases:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>No projects can be started with initial capital:</strong> If w is too low to start any project, the function returns the initial capital.</li>
            <li><strong>k is larger than the number of available projects:</strong> The function will complete all available projects and then return.</li>
            <li><strong>All projects have equal profit:</strong> The greedy approach still works because it prioritizes projects with lower capital requirements first.</li>
            <li><strong>Some projects have zero profit:</strong> The algorithm will only select such projects if no better options are available.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            This algorithm is optimal because at each step, we're always choosing the most profitable project among those we can start, which is the greedy choice property. Since profits are added to our capital, maximizing profit at each step leads to maximizing our final capital.
