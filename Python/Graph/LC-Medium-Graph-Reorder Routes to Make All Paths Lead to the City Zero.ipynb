    "## 1466. Reorder Routes to Make All Paths Lead to the City Zero\n",
    "https://leetcode.com/problems/reorder-routes-to-make-all-paths-lead-to-the-city-zero/\n",
    "\n",
    "There are n cities numbered from 0 to n - 1 and n - 1 roads such that there is only one way to travel between two different cities (this network form a tree). Last year, The ministry of transport decided to orient the roads in one direction because they are too narrow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Roads are represented by connections where connections[i] = [ai, bi] represents a road from city ai to city bi.\n",
    "\n",
    "This year, there will be a big event in the capital (city 0), and many people want to travel to this city.\n",
