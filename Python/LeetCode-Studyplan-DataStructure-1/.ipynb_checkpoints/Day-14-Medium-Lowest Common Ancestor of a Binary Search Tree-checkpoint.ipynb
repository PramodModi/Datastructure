    "## Problem: 235. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Search Tree\n",
    "https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-search-tree/\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) node of two given nodes in the BST.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”\n",

    "\n",
    "Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 8\n",
    "\n",
    "Output: 6\n",

    "\n",
    "Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 4\n",
    "\n",
    "Output: 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 4 is 2, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.\n",

    "Input: root = [2,1], p = 2, q = 1\n",

    "The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [2, 105].\n",
