    "You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street.

    "A recurrence relation to transition between states.\n",
    "For any recurrence relation, a good place to start is to think about a general state (in this case, let's say we're at the house at index i), and use information from the problem description to think about how other states relate to the current one.\n",
    "If we are at some house, logically, we have 2 options: we can choose to rob this house, or we can choose to not rob this house.\n",
    "If we decide not to rob the house, then we don't gain any money. Whatever money we had from the previous house is how much money we will have at this house - which is dp(i - 1).\n",
    "If we decide to rob the house, then we gain nums[i] money. However, this is only possible if we did not rob the previous house. This means the money we had when arriving at this house is the money we had from the previous house without robbing it, which would be however much money we had 2 houses ago, dp(i - 2). After robbing the current house, we will have\n",
    "dp(i - 2) + nums[i] money.\n",
    "From these two options, we always want to pick the one that gives us maximum profits. Putting it together, we have our recurrence relation: <b>dp(i)=max(dp(i - 1), dp(i - 2) + nums[i]) . </b>\n",
    "\n",
    "Base cases:\n",
    "if there is only one house, then the most money we can make is by robbing the house (the alternative is to not rob the house). If there are only two houses, then the most money we can make is by robbing the house with more money (since we have to choose between them). Therefore, our base cases are:\n",
