    "## 1706. Where Will the Ball Fall\n",
    "\n",
    "https://leetcode.com/problems/where-will-the-ball-fall/\n",
    "\n",
    "You have a 2-D grid of size m x n representing a box, and you have n balls. The box is open on the top and bottom sides.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each cell in the box has a diagonal board spanning two corners of the cell that can redirect a ball to the right or to the left.\n",
    "\n",
    "A board that redirects the ball to the right spans the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner and is represented in the grid as 1.\n",
    "A board that redirects the ball to the left spans the top-right corner to the bottom-left corner and is represented in the grid as -1.\n",
    "We drop one ball at the top of each column of the box. Each ball can get stuck in the box or fall out of the bottom. A ball gets stuck if it hits a \"V\" shaped pattern between two boards or if a board redirects the ball into either wall of the box.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return an array answer of size n where answer[i] is the column that the ball falls out of at the bottom after dropping the ball from the ith column at the top, or -1 if the ball gets stuck in the box.\n",
