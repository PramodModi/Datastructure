    "A query's waiting time is defined as the amount of time that it must wait before its execution starts. In\n",
    "other words, if a query is executed second, then its waiting time is the duration of the first query; if a\n",
    "query is executed third, then its waiting time is the sum of the durations of the first two queries.\n",
    "Write a function that returns the minimum amount of total waiting time for all of the queries. For\n",
    "example, if you're given the queries of durations [1, 4, 5] , then the total waiting time if the\n",
    "queries were executed in the order of [5, 1, 4] would be (0) + (5) + (5 + 1) = 11 . The\n",
    "first query of duration 5 would be executed immediately, so its waiting time would be 0 , the second\n",
