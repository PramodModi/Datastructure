    "For the purpose of this question, the phrases \"airport route\" and \"airport connection\" are used\n",
    "interchangeably.\n",
    "You're given a list of airports (three-letter codes like \"JFK\" ), a list of routes (one-way flights from one\n",
    "airport to another like [\"JFK\", \"SFO\"] ), and a starting airport.\n",
    "Write a function that returns the minimum number of airport connections (one-way flights) that need\n",
    "to be added in order for someone to be able to reach any airport in the list, starting at the starting\n",
    "airport.\n",
    "Note that routes only allow you to fly in one direction; for instance, the route [\"JFK\", \"SFO\"] only\n",
    "allows you to fly from \"JFK\" to \"SFO\" .\n",
    "Also note that the connections don't have to be direct; it's okay if an airport can only be reached from\n",
