    "1. Find all airports not reachable from this airports. That would be the maximum number of connections. However, we do not have to return maximum, but return minimum number of connections.\n",
    "2. To minimize the new connections, need to find out, among non-reachable airports, which airport connects maximum other airports which are non reachable from given airports. \n",
    "3. Sort the nonreachable airports in the number of reachable airports calculated at step2\n",
    "4. Iterate these airports. For 1st one, number of connection would be 1, then remove or marked other airports which can be reached via new connected airport. While iterating do not consider those airports which can be reachable with new connection.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, to code, need to create a graph for airports and uts routes.\n",
    "Also, airport node should have attribute which can help to identify, if this airport is reachable from asked airport or not. Also, it should have list of all non reachable airports."
