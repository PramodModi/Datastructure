    "You're looking to move into a new apartment on specific street, and you're given a list of contiguous\n",
    "blocks on that street where each block contains an apartment that you could move into.\n",
    "You also have a list of requirements: a list of buildings that are important to you. For instance, you\n",
    "might value having a school and a gym near your apartment. The list of blocks that you have contains\n",
    "information at every block about all of the buildings that are present and absent at the block in\n",
    "question. For instance, for every block, you might know whether a school, a pool, an office, and a gym\n",
    "are present.\n",
    "In order to optimize your life, you want to pick an apartment block such that you minimize the farthest\n",
    "distance you'd have to walk from your apartment to reach any of your required buildings.\n",
