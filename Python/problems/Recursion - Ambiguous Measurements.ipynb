    "## Problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem deals with measuring cups that are missing important measuring labels. Specifically, a\n",
    "measuring cup only has two measuring lines, a Low (L) line and a High (H) line. This means that these\n",
    "cups can't precisely measure and can only guarantee that the substance poured into them will be\n",
    "between the L and H line. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you might have a measuring cup that has a Low line at 400ml\n",
    "and a high line at 435ml . This means that when you use this measuring cup, you can only be sure\n",
    "that what you're measuring is between 400ml and 435ml .\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You're given a list of measuring cups containing their low and high lines as well as one low integer\n",
    "and one high integer representing a range for a target measurement. Write a function that returns a\n",
    "boolean representing whether you can use the cups to accurately measure a volume in the specified\n",
    "[low, high] range (the range is inclusive).\n",
    "Note that:\n",
    "Each measuring cup will be represented by a pair of positive integers [L, H] , where\n",
    "0 <= L <= H .\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll always be given at least one measuring cup, and the low and high input parameters\n",
    "will always satisfy the following constraint: 0 <= low <= high .\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've measured some liquid, it will immediately be transferred to a larger bowl that will\n",
    "eventually (possibly) contain the target measurement.\n",
    "You can't pour the contents of one measuring cup into another cup.\n",
