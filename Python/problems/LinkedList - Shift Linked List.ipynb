    "Write a function that takes in the head of a Singly Linked List and an integer k , shifts the list in place\n",
    "(i.e., doesn't create a brand new list) by k positions, and returns its new head.\n",
    "Shifting a Linked List means moving its nodes forward or backward and wrapping them around the list\n",
    "where appropriate. For example, shifting a Linked List forward by one position would make its tail\n",
    "become the new head of the linked list.\n",
    "Whether nodes are moved forward or backward is determined by whether k is positive or negative.\n",
    "Each LinkedList node has an integer value as well as a next node pointing to the next node in\n",
    "the list or to None / null if it's the tail of the list.\n",
    "You can assume that the input Linked List will always have at least one node; in other words, the head\n",
    "will never be None / null .\n",
