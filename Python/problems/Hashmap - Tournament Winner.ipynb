    "each competition, one team is designated the home team, while the other team is the away team. In\n",
    "each competition there's always one winner and one loser; there are no ties. A team receives 3 points if\n",
    "it wins and 0 points if it loses. The winner of the tournament is the team that receives the most amount\n",

    "has elements in the form of [homeTeam, awayTeam] , where each team is a string of at most 30\n",
    "characters representing the name of the team. The results array contains information about the\n",
    "winner of each corresponding competition in the competitions array. Specifically, results[i]\n",
    "denotes the winner of competitions[i] , where a 1 in the results array means that the home\n",
